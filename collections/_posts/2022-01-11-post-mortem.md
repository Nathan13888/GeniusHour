First off, a little *nota bene*: this is me (Jasmine “what do you mean 20 pages is a lot” Ah Yong). So… this is gonna be long. (It takes me longer to edit things down than it does for me to word vomit.) I have regrets, and a lot of them. I’ll put a bullet point summary down at the bottom, but the main body of this post is going to be a ton of reflection on pretty much everything. I don’t expect you to read through this whole thing, necessarily -- information that qualifies as “important” to me rarely coincides with the general population’s definition. So.

In light of the many (*many*) blog posts, experiments, and write-ups that were done, it is quite self-evident that this project was a bit of a winding road. Looking back, there are a lot of things that could have been changed to make our work more interesting, accessible, and relevant.

## General Reflections

Perhaps our greatest misstep was in failing to immediately identify a precise area of focus. I think this was borne of a variety of different factors -- time pressure, unfamiliarity with the topic, and communication struggles all come to mind. Our group had the unique challenge of an even online/in-person split, which placed a huge strain on our ability to make decisions in a timely manner. To some degree, I think there was a constant cloud of vague confusion hanging over our work. My response to this was to do *all* the things -- someone says something might be a decent idea and I am immediately planning it all out.

(I am an obsessive person who can go on and *on* and ***on***. The reason we have this extension in the first place is pretty much because I couldn’t sleep while feeling like the project was “unfinished”. And that’s a problem -- because it is simply not possible to go in depth about everything under the sun. Any time someone suggests I do something, I jump on it instantly and with a bit too much vigour -- hence, you know, the hundreds of samples, multiple hand-knitted projects, and excessive quantities of blog posts and write-ups. I mean -- in which universe, pray tell, were *burn tests* necessary?)

The easiest way to simplify the project would be to focus on one type of dye -- maybe, possibly 2. Likewise, narrowing down the fabric swatch situation to 2 or 3 fibres would help with allowing the information to be disseminated more effectively. There is literally no physical way (... other than travelling past the speed of light while presenting so that time is warped?) to analyze the minute differences between over 350 swatches in 10 minutes. That’s under 2 seconds for each swatch.

In this case, it would make good sense to analyze two dyes with significantly different properties. The most obvious distinction to go with would probably be hydrophobic vs. hydrophilic, so I think doing an acid dye and a disperse dye makes the most sense. In terms of sourcing materials, disperse dyes are a little more dubious (home synthetic dyeing is not really as big of a thing, and scientific warehouses don’t always supply safe/affordable chemicals). However, I know that Rit DyeMore is a disperse/direct blend, and Rit All Purpose is an acid/direct blend. There is, consequently, at least some modicum of comparison that can be performed there, since the direct component is being held constant (even though it’d be a nicer experiment if it wasn’t there at all).

On that note, I think that the whole hat exploration was a solid jumping off point. It’s something that has a nice visual demonstration, something that has the potential to be interesting to people interested in chemistry, textile arts, both, or neither. The materials are accessible enough, while the project dives into an attractively niche field where *something* is bound to catch your interest. All that makes it something that’s easy to riff off of, because you can get your hands on similar resources, and then do some experimentation that pertains to your interests.

The problem is that we didn’t jump off from there -- instead, it’s where we *landed*. There’s a pretty amazing study to be done based on the hat -- you could easily take the wool/acrylic fabric and dunk it into a disperse dye and then an acid dye. That’d give two samples to analyze (albeit 4 fibre uptakes) -- which gives a solid 176 times the amount of time to analyze each one compared to the under two seconds we were dealing with before.

If we wanted to, based on that analysis, further swatch work could be done just with different additives and heat settings. Even with the two heat settings and four additive settings, that’s still just 32 swatches (which is downright minimalist compared to 352). I think that it might be better, though, to work with one additive at different concentrations. This would give a very direct comparison -- more vinegar makes more red, for example. That way, we’re not wrestling with the implications of all the other chemical properties that might be impacting the results.

Food dye was definitely the easiest to research. That’s a natural consequence of the fact that food products have to be a bit more open about their ingredients (in contrast to, say, fountain pen ink). As a result, the content can actually be picked apart. Relevant chemical formulas can be spewed and structural diagrams can be thrown up. And it’s not just accessible in terms of research -- it’s also an accessible resource and a relatable (ish) topic. Most people don’t know the first thing about dye chemistry, whether that be food colours or textile dyes. However, a great deal of people have used food dyes, and most likely have subsequently stained their hands or counter tops or clothes with them. That’s always good for relatability and… coolness?

Other dyes were a bit more of a struggle. Tulip I managed to work out by hunting down old MSDS PDFs from a supplier with a deeply questionable name. Rit was a little harder -- there was no information to be found on the internet (the SDS kept everything behind trade secrets) and I had to reach out to the company 3 or 4 times (through 3 or 4 different channels) before I managed to get a response on dye composition. Diamine? I never found *anything* even vaguely helpful there -- sure, there were a couple of papers about general fountain pen ink composition, some forum posts on Fountain Pen Network, and a rather outdated and sketchy contact form on their half-broken website, but… definitely nothing that ascertained any important information. I used every search term and read through dozens of forum threads, and came up pretty much as empty handed as that time a journal literally said “a review of the literature found nothing”.

Speaking of the secondary research struggle, I guess this is where I formally admit that the intention was to do a comparison with a plain *disperse* dye, not a disperse/direct blend. Unfortunately, given that it did take a couple of weeks to get my hands on the dye composition, and by the time I did get it there was no time to try to order a pure disperse online (the only other synthetic dye I can imagine being locally available would be iDye, but I’m about 80% sure that’s also a disperse/direct blend).

That’s not the only difficulty with sourcing materials, though. There’s also the simple matter of the fact that all the dyes used were vastly different from each other. Food dye comes at a different concentration than bottled dye, and both of those are in liquid form whereas the reactive dye came as a powder. I did a ton of math beforehand to try to make sure they’d all be the same concentration, but… I’ve gotta admit that I don’t think that worked. I’ll spare you the five page rant about marketing, but basically, just because a company *says* that *x* is the right concentration of dye for *y* amount of fabric, doesn’t mean that those numbers are accurate. In future, I think it’d make sense to do pre-pre-experiment-experiments (as in, experiments before the experiments before the experiments before the experiment) to familiarize ourselves with the materials with which we’re working. Besides the concentration issues, there’s also just the hue -- I like to think my dye mixtures were all… reasonably close in hue. But I do know that the food dye and the reactive dye were probably a bit more red-toned, as was the fountain pen ink. The disperse dye had some red in it, but also a lot of blue and black. Whatever the specifics are, the reality is that it makes it harder to analyze when the baseline is uncertain.

And then there is the issue of measurement, born both of the issue of hue variations and other problems. Based on my lack of equipment (i.e., based on the fact that I don’t own a photospectrometer, nor do I have a small-granularity scale) and my lack of experience in measuring dye uptake (turns out there’s a lot more formulas and math than I anticipated), there was a complete and total inability to really take any quantitative measurements of the results. Plus, I wasn’t able to obtain pure whites for all the sample bases, so there’s that issue to grapple with.

However, this dubious accuracy wasn’t just due to a lack of resources, it was also due to me just being flat-out lazy and/or reckless. I could have at least bothered with trying to take pH measurements (even if it was just with decade-old pH strips from some experiment kit or another) for the fabrics and diluted dye/additive solutions. (The results would be hard to read, because… still can’t determine the exact colour. Also, dyes are pigmented, and the detergent was blue.) And sure, the benefits of that one are dubious, but my laziness using med cups instead of droppers for measuring dyes/additives was pretty inexcusable (how exactly did I think I was going to measure out 2 mL dye in a pill cup?). So -- note to self, in the future, use every tool at your disposal.

I guess that’s the biggest lesson I personally took away from this project (apart from all the chemistry, of course) -- just work with what is available. Use Wikipedia. Read the Reddit posts by people with questionable usernames. Repurpose the empty pasta sauce jars and food colouring vials. Dig out the years-old yarns of deeply terrible quality and the curtains that have been repurposed dozens of times. Use grocery store food colouring as acid dye. Do burn tests on the mystery fabrics in the basement.

Remember that half the work in any project is finding value in whatever comes.

## Summary

Things to improve:

- Emphasize communication. Check in with each other, be honest about our progress, and ensure that adjustments are made where necessary (and that they are properly communicated). Never be afraid to initiate conversation if there are things we are confused about.
- Narrow down on area of focus. Work with less swatches and samples; a better option might have been just looking at acrylic/wool and disperse/acid. This would allow proper analysis of each case, as well as further in depth research for bits that raise question marks.
- Choose something “interesting” from the get-go rather than at the end. Build the project to be interesting to someone who knows nothing, rather than to someone who has a strong pre-existing foundation of knowledge.
- Try to find more pure materials for experiments. (Don’t blow the budget, but preferably ensure that your “disperse” dye is actually just a disperse dye.)
Take more quantitative measurements. (This is not always possible, but make a concerted effort to problem-solve.)

Lessons learned:

- Research in the “weird” places and use the “unreliable” sources. Read the Reddit threads, pour over random forums, and scrub through product listings. Even if these are unconventional ways of obtaining information -- and no, they’re not solid sources to cite -- they are good ways to get started and find better keywords with which to do “proper” research.
- Do not fall down the rabbit hole. Do the work, yes, and grasp at straws when researching if you must. But do not delude yourself into believing that reviewing all the literature in the world will be worth it for a school project. (Do not rush to finish reading the thousands of pages -- they may be interesting, but if they are not immediately important, they should be set aside.)
- No amount of hard work can make information magically materialize. Be aware of what we are not capable of on our own, when we should ask for help, and when help is not possible to obtain. Walk away from the impossible quests trying to research the internet for information that isn’t there.
- Talk to people in the industry. Do so early and often -- they have more knowledge than you (99% of the time), and being able to take these facts into account during the beginning stages of a project is invaluable.

## Future Questions

Alright, so -- will this ever actually get researched? I certainly can’t guarantee that. But right now, while I’m still knee-deep in this project and working through regrets and improvements, I for one can definitely think of a couple of research questions that could be looked into in the future.

(These are all more “what?” than “how?” or “why?”, because as I have learned from both this and Tortuostudy, there are not always actually answers to those kinds of questions, and I do not currently have the resources to answer them myself. The how and why of things can only be genuinely explored after the what is discovered.)

- What further conclusions might be found if more factors were held constant (e.g., using only anthraquinone dyes, etc.)?
- What kind of relationship might appear if tests were done at graduated additions (e.g. adjusting the dyebath saturation, keeping the bath at specific temperature intervals, etc.)?
- What is the long term colourfastness of the dyes/fabrics, beyond an initial wash? What might happen in a wash with detergent or in hot water? What is the impact of an extended bath in water or light?
- What is the impact of dyebath saturation on hue uptake? Would using a less saturated acid dye stock result in more blue uptake? What gradient might be achieved by dyeing subsequent samples in the same dyebath, given the different strike rates for different pigments?
- What differences might there be between detergent and baking soda as basic dye additives? Does one, both, or neither have an impact on hue and saturation?
- Is time, temperature, or dye bath saturation most impactful?
- What is the relationship between dye uptake and colourfastness? Does higher uptake indicate stronger bonds and thus greater fastness properties, or, conversely, would it result in more colour bleeding due to potential oversaturation rendering dye build-up as unstable?
