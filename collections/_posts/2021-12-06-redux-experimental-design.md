It is said that no battle plan survives first contact with the enemy.

This isn’t a bad thing. Because I don’t think it’s so much about an inability to survive as it is about the ability to adapt. It’s not even about having a bad plan in the first place. And the thing is, you could dig your heels in, refuse to change the plan. The battle plan would survive, even if you might not. Or, you could look at the situation, take note of how you could improve, and then take action to make your performance better.

Failing to plan is planning to fail, but refusing to ever change the plan? That’s shooting yourself in the foot.

It should come as no surprise, then, that the original experimental design document – posted before I started working through the experiment – is not 100% reflective of what ended up happening. Adjustments were made along the way. The following is an overview of the changes I made and why, and a PDF containing a revised experiment procedure can be found [ERRATA 2021.12.16: 1.25 mL food colouring should be added to each dyebath] [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1oWzcSQVJdO0K7FSIWbDjZ6_O5nxLl9ci/view?usp=sharing).

## Dye Concentration

The initial experimental design treated the concentration of food colouring, bottled dye, and prepared tie-dye as the same. Unfortunately, this was a rather misguided assumption. Right off the bat, once I mixed the first dye bath for the food colouring, it was clear that the saturation levels were way too high. This was backed up by the fact that the dye baths did not exhaust, even when applied at high heat with the addition of vinegar. While reactive dyes are notorious for not exhausting, acid dyes normally do – and I can speak to that from experience. I know that these food colourings are capable of exhausting on wool yarns, because I have literally done it before (on a different wool yarn, but still).

As a reactionary measure, I increased the concentration of the disperse dyes in experiment, and to a lesser degree, the reactive dyes. I am not going to link all the many accounts that I read in order to determine my final values – there are wildly different numbers depending on where you look, and so much of decision-making winds up being gut instinct. The following are the revised quantities of liquid dye per dye bath: 1.25 mL food colouring, 3.75 mL Rit DyeMore, 2.5 mL Tulip Tie Dye, and 0.125 mL Diamine Ink. This treats the food colouring as more concentrated than the fabric dyes, and considers that the tie dye is more saturated than the immersion dye.

## Fabric Pretreatment

The original experimental design had each of the samples pre-soaked in water for 10 minutes. I believe that this was initially written when we were thinking about dip-dyeing the samples in order to demonstrate the relevant of capillary action. As it stands, however, there was no real point to presoaking (yes, it would improve the evenness of the dye, but this is not, in my opinion, worth what the requisite resource expenditure would be).

I completely skipped the presoaking, and instead just added the fibres to the dye bath dry.

## Dye Time

I initially had the fabrics submerged in the dye for 30 minutes. However, 10 minutes into the first sample – having had to stand there and watch it to ensure that the camera didn’t break – I realized that 30 minutes was impractical. For 32 dye baths, that would take 16 hours.

Consequently, I decided to go for 20 minutes instead. I feel that this is a good compromise – 10 minutes is enough for most fibres, but more stubborn ones (like polyester) often need at least double that.

## Rinse Depth

In order to measure the degree of colour-fastness, I originally planned to rinse only half of each strip in cold water. Within approximately 0.01 seconds of rinsing the first sample, I realized that this was a terrible idea: keeping the samples organized that none of the “unrinsed” sides get wet, coupled with finding a place to dye the samples so that they wouldn’t stain things, proved to be difficult.

As a result, I rinsed the entirety of all the samples. I did all this on camera, so we are still able to analyze the impact of rinsing on the colour of the sample, but without dealing with as much of the mess.

## Minor Experiments

Many of the extra experiments I wanted to run had to be cut due to resource constraints. Some others were added.

The pH experiment was removed. Based on the amount of time and materials I had, I realized that testing pH could be quite costly. I would have to test the pH of dye (which is difficult since it’s so heavily pigmented), then the pH of 11 different textile samples (not terrible, if a bit of a nuisance since it cannot be measured directly), and finally the pH of all 352 dyed samples (three hundred and fifty two!). That’s a lot of time, a lot of pH strips, and also – a lot of potential for skewed final subjects (soaking in water would change the dye saturation, in all likelihood – wet-fastness certainly varies for different dyes and fibres).

However, we decided to add a “cooler” demonstration to the mix – a hand-knit hat with a “secret pattern” on it. This isn’t really an experiment (it’s a one-time demonstration, even though I did do some experiments beforehand to ensure that it would go smoothly), so I will expand on that in a future blog post.

## Small Adjustments

Other small adjustments were made throughout the procedure – adding a simple check for the heat of the dye baths and allowing for stirring, for example. I also added some notes to the procedure for clarity.

Final experimental design document can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1oWzcSQVJdO0K7FSIWbDjZ6_O5nxLl9ci/view?usp=sharing). (The math appendices have been removed since many of the numbers have been changed, and because it is unnecessary clutter.)
