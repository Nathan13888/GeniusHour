## Defining Genius Hour

During Genius Hour, an *hour* is set aside to explore one’s *genius* through free-range curiosity. More importantly, it is not limited to a strict definition; it can also be taken in various figurative contexts, and ultimately comprises significant time ("hour") set aside dedicated to exploring any projects that focus on one’s interests/passions (“genius”)

## Topic Brainstorm

We came up with three different potential topics, and brainstormed three questions regarding each.

### Topic I: Dyeing

1. Why is polyester hydrophobic? Why is polyamide hydrophilic? Are there ways to change these properties?
2. What type of dye is actually most effective for nylon, since it’s not hydrophobic (as opposed to polyester, which tends to require disperse dyes due to its hydrophobia)? Would reactive dye be able to covalently bond to it? Would disperse dyes bond as effectively if applied without heat?
3. Since synthetic fibres don’t (typically) exhaust dyestock, how effectively can dyestuffs be reused without losing potency? Does reuse have an impact on vibrancy or colour fastness?

### Topic II: Cooking

1. What are the acid/base properties in baking soda and powder? What are the practical effects of these properties, and why are they important? How might one work around them?
2. What different chemical reactions occur when cooking something for a long time at a lower temperature vs. cooking for a shorter time at a higher temperature?
3. How can one predict the physical characteristics present in an end product based on the ratio of inputs used? (Make one of those "you added too much…" ingredient charts)

### Topic III: Textiles

1. What allows certain textiles to be water resistant (ski jackets) and what is chemically different between materials with different waterproof ratings. Why does washing these fabrics using a machine washer damage the water resistance of these materials?
2. Why is the burn test used for predicting fibre composition? What chemical properties cause groups of fibres to react in specific ways (i.e. melting for synthetics, ash production for proteins, etc.)?
3. What fibres are ideal for swimwear? How does chlorine impact various materials with regards to life span, elastic modulus, colour fastness, etc.?

## Conclusions

Our group decided to focus on dyeing for several reasons:
- It would be able to produce a show-and-tell component that appeals to a wide range of people through the power of visual communication.
- The topic is relevant to people of all walks of life, since dyes are present everywhere. However, it is also a topic that is not frequently discussed, and therefore remains an area that may spark curiosity in larger audiences.
- Experiments can be performed safely with relatively few precautions, making it ideal for at-home experimentation. Additionally, this makes it more conducive to videography.
- There is a strong connection to various topics covered in this course; hydrocarbons (organic chemistry), intermolecular/intramolecular forces
- Our group  already has resources (various dyes and inks) available that are suitable for experimentation
