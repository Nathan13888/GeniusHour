Full disclosure -- I may have gotten around to editing this thanks to the extension, but my health has been a trainwreck recently, and I have not had the requisite spoons to make this perfect. As such, the structural formulas are still somewhat different sizes (and qualities) and the alt text is not amazing.

Again, the PDF form can be found on Google Drive [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1kfbSkPeOJQYT6vISfGqBiF1Aa4k9zkxG/view?usp=sharing). Given that I already wrote up a blog post last time -- and much of the content is similar to what's already [here](https://nathan13888.github.io/GeniusHour/blog/2021-12-07-material-data-sheet/) -- I'm only going to make a note of things I've updated in this post. Read the PDF if you want full details.

## Dyes

Added IUPAC names for everything, as well as chemical formulas for non-pigment related ingredients in the prepared dyes (e.g. propylparaben). A couple of sample images were added and/or updated in order to better reflect reality, and image alt text was added and/or updated. Formatting was also edited in some cases for consistency. Structural formulas were enlarged for readability.

## Additives

Vinegar section was updated to include IUPAC name, chemical formula, and structural formula diagram.

## Fabrics

Revised to add additional information regarding weight; gsm, wpi, etc. were added where the information was obtainable. Image alt text was also fixed.
