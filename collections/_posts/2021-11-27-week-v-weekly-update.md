## Executive Summary

In the past week, our team has made great progress on our deliverables and planning. Most notably, we have **gathered all resources for our hands-on** scientific study involving multiple types of dyes and inks and have begun our analysis of their properties. We have also been **regularly writting blog updates** on our progress while we have been planning our experiments, website and hands on component. We have also **completed the first version** of the website and will be continuing to improve the user experience and content on the website in the upcoming weeks!

## Challenges We Have Faced

Our largest challenge to date has been organizing a series of experiments that accurately experiments a series of that is representative of as many fabric and dye combinations. More importantly, we also wanted to account for how the presence of a **detergent** and **acidic environments** impact the dyeing process. Through our research, we have **made predictions** based on the chemical reactions involved and knowledge behind the way humans perceive colour. So far we have settle at approximate six different types of fabrics. Since we will be testing different dyes under different conditions with each fabric, the number of samples will grow very quickly.

## Future Goals

In the next several weeks as we complete this project, we will be completing the rest of our research, website, video and hands-on product! In order to create the video, we must plan and write a script. Currently, Jasmine has already started conducting parts of the experiment which involved. We aim to have made good progress on the script and experiments by the time we return in two weeks! For the website, we will continue writing updates like these and make improvements on the website design.
