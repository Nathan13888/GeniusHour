After dozens of pages, hundreds of samples, thousands of hours (ok, well, I didn't log all our hours, but breaking 1000 definitely seems realistic), and millions of agitated noises of frustration, I can admit that navigating this project without a guide might be a bit of a nightmare. So. Here's a guide.

## Project Summary

Our project consisted of four primary objectives:

- primary research through experimentation (i.e. dyeing 350+ samples to analyze impact of different chemical environments)
- secondary research through literature review (i.e. reading research reports and books to gain further background information and knowledge on that which we did not have the resources to do first hand)
- teaching through demonstration (i.e. knitting and dyeing a hat to show a way in which this knowledge might be used and provide visual interest)
- edutainment\* through comedic instruction (i.e. detective video to present findings in a humourous manner)

\* portmanteau of "education" and "entertainment"

## Blog

The blog is accessible via the [homepage](https://nathan13888.github.io/GeniusHour/) of this site. It covers our progress throughout the course of this progress, and generally takes on a fairly informal (though not entirely unprofessional) tone. Given the nature of a blog -- and the time constraints that come along with real-time updates -- some posts absolutely do reflect moments of... dubious health. Brief behind-the-scenes type information is included with posts for project deliverables.

All of the posts on this site have been tagged with one (1) category. These are:

- [Conference Rundowns](https://nathan13888.github.io/GeniusHour/category/conference-rundowns): preparatory notes for confernces and reflections on thoughts based on them
- [Project Details](https://nathan13888.github.io/GeniusHour/category/project-details/): current information directly pertaining to project deliverables (e.g. experimental desgin, process videos, bibliography, etc.)
- [Archives](https://nathan13888.github.io/GeniusHour/category/archives/): posts that were at one time current project details, but which contained errata or which were later updated based on extensions or other situational factors
- [Weekly Updates](https://nathan13888.github.io/GeniusHour/category/weekly-updates/): mostly weekly posts reviewing progress and goals as a generalized time log
- [Reflections](https://nathan13888.github.io/GeniusHour/category/reflections/): informal rambles covering personal thoughts on project improvements and lessons learned

Project details PDFs will also be linked in one of the following sections on this post.

## Gallery

The gallery can be found [here](https://nathan13888.github.io/GeniusHour/gallery). The link is also at the top right of the website. It includes images of all 352 dyed samples (i.e. fabric swatches -- does not include hat photos). Probably the best way to get a look at the samples in their most "natural" form for first-hand analysis.

## Google Drive

Also linked at the top right of the website, access to our Google Drive can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1tMdN1I9MV_sfzvuXi5_gYrrJhWl475pv). That includes raw video files, research documents, drafts, brainstorming, and final products. Pretty much the entirety of the work completed for this project is contained there.

*Nota bene*, though, that some (many) of the documents there were abandoned at some point. Whether that was for rewriting, because it no longer made sense to spend time on it, or whatever else, the reality is that not everything goes through to completion. They are still there, for posterity (amd because things can still be useful, even if they never get formally published) -- but they're not complete or edited.

And -- full disclosure, not *everything* is there. Some drafts were written in Word, others were done by hand, and yet more were just never moved into that folder (because I in particular have way too many planning documents -- spread across way too many places -- to get them all together).

## Github Repository

If you, for whatever reason, want to look at the source code for this website, access to our GitHub repository is available through the link at the top right of the site, or through [this](https://github.com/Nathan13888/GeniusHour) link. Here you can find the present code as well as commit history (although you will find that much of that is embarrassingly useless attempts on my end to operate technology).

For more information on the website, a blog post on its construction can be found [here](https://nathan13888.github.io/GeniusHour/blog/2021-12-16-how-we-built-the-website/).

## Report

Also linked at the top of this page; it can be found on Google Drive [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Bya3sSE8T4Dv_GVGCUVFW2QnxY1hFj4K/view?usp=sharing) and on Dropbox [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/abjt17xpn7s5i6c/finalpaperv.3.6.pdf?dl=0). The up-to-date blog post on it can be found [here](https://nathan13888.github.io/GeniusHour/blog/2022-01-15-redux-final-paper/) and the archived one is [here](https://nathan13888.github.io/GeniusHour/blog/2021-12-17-final-paper/).

The report covers a basic literature review, experimental procedure, results, and vague conclusions. This is your best bet for a (relatively) quick look at all the key points of the project.

## Videos

The videos produced for this project can also be found in the carousel on the [homepage](https://nathan13888.github.io/GeniusHour/).

- [How They Dyed: A Chemystery](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0NtmkcuxkQ): our final video; a comedic take on fantastical murder-mystery detective work featuring dye sample analysis and experimentation
- [fair isle contrast \| impractical solutions](https://youtu.be/VKyVxNapFOY): a video covering the entire creation process for a resist-dyed stranded colourwork hat, including an explanation of the chemistry behind the process; this reflects a more real-world application example with the same basic concepts as those covered in our demonstration
- [Knitting + Dyeing the Rekindling Hat](https://youtu.be/7xaW4bBOjN0): casual video covering the actual literal entire creation process for the hat, but without any real chemistry content; for if you are interested in the crafting side of things

*fair isle contrast \| impractical solutions* has also been uploaded as two separate videos for the [process](https://youtu.be/G5-wlJjn280) and [analysis](https://youtu.be/DvJTKKMneBM) for hopefuly easier viewing.

## Project Details PDFs

All of the PDFs containing details pertaining to the project have been uploaded to both Google Drive and Dropbox. Google Drive is accessible only to PDSB accounts, but Dropbox should be universally available. Documents can also be sent out on an individual basis if neither of those links are operational.

The following list will include links to the most current blog post (linked as the title), any archived blog posts, the Google Drive PDF, and the Dropbox PDF.

- [Experimental Design](https://nathan13888.github.io/GeniusHour/blog/2021-12-06-redux-experimental-design/) ([Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1oWzcSQVJdO0K7FSIWbDjZ6_O5nxLl9ci/view?usp=sharing) \| [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/s/zr8ors6cgdadrco/experimental%20design%20redux.pdf?dl=0)): covers the procedure for the 352 dyeing samples; the [archived post](https://nathan13888.github.io/GeniusHour/blog/2021-11-22-experimental-design/) includes a bunch of information on how it was developed, which was removed in the update since it turns out that much of that math was unsuccessful anyways, but the PDF for that can be found on [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1DZGF680ARMBXBzP1tZ__GN-TyKwg9a3m/view?usp=sharing) and [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/s/7jmwuk7ay2zvyzl/experimentaldesign.pdf?dl=0)

- [Bibliography](https://nathan13888.github.io/GeniusHour/blog/2022-01-16-redux-updated-bibliography/) ([Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1qbB-y23kIuizqPThfiRaIyK3W0aR-XlB/view?usp=sharing) \| [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/s/gb6q2qq389l62cr/redux%20Updated%20Bibliography.v.1.1.pdf?dl=0)): list of sources consulted during the project, though without annotation (annotated bibliography PDFs can be found on [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1DL1HD_raEAGdlNlpE71cIoOUmD78cFBx/view?usp=sharing) and [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/s/kds3v7vvnr2crzh/References%20_%20Genius%20Hour%20_%20SCH4UE-A.pdf?dl=0)); the original blog post can be found [here](https://nathan13888.github.io/GeniusHour/blog/2021-11-23-annotated-bibliography/), although there was a second posts [here](https://nathan13888.github.io/GeniusHour/blog/2021-12-16-updated-bibliography/) that also ended up archived
