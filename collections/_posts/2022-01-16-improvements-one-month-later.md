## Website

Over the past several weeks we continued improving the website content and made various tweaks to the design of the website. Most notably, we have improved the way the gallery displays the various images by cropping the images into squares instead! There have also been many blog updates thanks to Jasmine on progress updates on things that we have done in the past few weeks. A notably [blog post is aptly named "post mortem"](https://nathan13888.github.io/GeniusHour/blog/2022-01-11-post-mortem/), which reflects on the progress we have made so far.

## Final Report

Our group has made massive improvements and updates to [**our final report**](https://nathan13888.github.io/GeniusHour/assets/report.pdf); most notably, compiling a visual and qualitative comparison between the numberous samples in the experiment *(special thanks to Jasmine ãƒ„)*, and optimized the format and wording used in our report.

## Presentation

In preparation for a potential 100% online presentation, we have familiarized ourselves with the Microsoft Teams screenshare functions and the way we would coordinate the presentation. Furthermore, we have created a Google Slides presentation that incorporates our video, research and live demonstration in an easily digestible manner! During the presentation, we will feature a **live dyeing demonstration** which involves a hand-knitted square swatch made of multiple materials. Using heat, we could **accelerate the dyeing** so we could show the results at the end of the presentation.
