## Summary

This post will not include all the information regarding experimental design, since there is a lot of information, including equations. However, a simple summary is included below. We reserve the right to alter experimental design at our sole discretion through the course of this project.

### Materials

textile | dyes | additives
---------- | ---------- | -----------
cotton | food colouring | salt
jute | tie dye | detergent
paper towel | disperse dye | vinegar
bamboo | |
polyurethane | |
nylon | |
acrylic | |
polyester | |
polyethylene | |
wool | |
silk | |

Approximately 26 g of each textile, 16 mL of each dye, and 20 mL of each additive is required.

### Procedure

1. Cut swatches of fibrous materials, approximately 1” by 6” each. (For yarn samples, cut pieces 24” long and fold them into quarters.) Aim for a total of 9 g.
2. Presoak in room temperature water. Do not add anything to this solution. Leave to soak for 10 minutes. Gently squeeze to get rid of excess water before adding to the dye bath.
3. Add 225 mL water to a clean jar. Note that this jar should be transparent to facilitate note-taking, and must be heat-resistant to ensure safety.
4. IF RELEVANT: bring 2 L of water to a boil. Place a cooling rack over the pot, then place the jar on top of the rack. (Another double-boiling set up may be used if more accessible. Alternatively, the jar can be skipped entirely, and the dye bath can go directly into the pot. Do whatever is most accessible and safe in your environment.)
5. IF RELEVANT: add 2.5 mL additives to the dyebath. 
6. Add 2 mL of dye to the jar. This should be about 40 drops of food colouring. Stir well. (This concentration may vary when working with different pigmentations, and is based on numbers most relevant to fabric dyes. See the math for the procedure in this regard.)
7. Add textile subjects to the dyebath, submerging fully.
8. Let sit for 30 minutes, maintaining a constant temperature. Do not stir. You may wish to use a chopstick or other small utensil to keep textiles submerged.
9. Remove fabrics from the dyebath. Lay flat to dry.
10. IF RELEVANT: Rinse half of each strip in cool water until water runs clear.
11. OPTIONAL: Add scrap fabric to the dye bath to exhaust any remaining colour. You may wish to change additives or temperature in order to best use up resources.
