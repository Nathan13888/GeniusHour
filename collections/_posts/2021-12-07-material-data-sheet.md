This was a content-heavy piece, containing a significant amount of text and images, so it can be found in PDF form [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1NWOqqXqVb8PQJOjicIENk1CoqcwrTcM8/view?usp=sharing). This version has some information condensed and the images have been removed.

Just to be clear, this is not an SDS. Instead, this is an overview of the materials used in our experiments, their physical and chemical properties, and other information.

It is also not an analysis of experiment results. This document only covers the materials to the extent that they can be analyzed before experimentation (i.e. basic secondary research).

Citations will be included in the final annotated bibliography.

## Dyes

This subsection comprises all the dyes used in the experiments. Many of the listed chemicals have a great deal of synonyms; the first name listed reflects the one used in the sources we consulted.

Abbreviations of note: FD&C (federal food, drug, and cosmetic act), FCF (for coloring food), CI (color index)

### Diamine Fountain Pen Inks

We have reached out to Diamine Inks LTD regarding the chemical composition of their fountain pen inks but have yet to receive a response. The following comprises the extremely limited scope of information we were able to locate online.

#### Water-Based
Multiple accounts, including various retailers, state that Diamine Fountain Pen Inks are water-based and water-soluble. This is relevant to dyeing in that this property will make it difficult for the ink to overcome hydrophobic barriers.

#### Dye-Based
According to the vast majority of the sources consulted (there was one outlier), this ink is dye-based (rather than pigment-based). This is beneficial to this experiment as dyes tend to perform better in dyeing capacities.

### Clubhouse Neon Food Colouring

We have reached out to McCormick & Company, Inc for further information on the chemistry of their food dyes but have not gotten an answer. While a significant amount of information was able to be ascertained nonetheless, there are some limits on the details.

The following comprises the ingredients present in the colours utilized for the experiment.

#### Water
As per usual, water is present in this product. It acts as a solvent and carrier for the dye.

#### Propylene Glycol
A water-absorbent synthetic liquid, used in some industries (including food) as an antifreeze.

#### Colors
All of the dyes used in this product are acid dyes (i.e. consisting of sulphonic acid component and a chromophore component). The ingredients list simply says “colors”, but the Q&A section for the Neon Food Colouring on ClubHouse’s website provides further details:

##### Allura Red

A red azo dye also known as FD&C Red 40 and CI Food Red 17, among others. While we were unable to ascertain a formal CI Acid number for this chemical, analysis of the chemical structure shows that it is indeed an acid dye. In particular, it is the sodium salt of a sulfonic acid (sulfonated dyes are a quite common application method for acid dye).

The preferred IUPAC name is disodium 6-hydroxy-5-[(2-methoxy-5-methyl-4-sulfonatophenyl)diazenyl]naphthalene-2-sulfonate.

##### Erythrosine

Another red acid dye, known as FD&C Red 3, CI Food Red 14, and CI Acid Red 51 (again, there are more).

The preferred IUPAC name is 2-(6-hydroxy-2,4,5,7-tetraiodo-3-oxo-xanthen-9-yl)benzoic acid.

##### Brilliant Blue FCF

A blue acid dye intended for food use. Names include FD&C Blue 1 and CI Acid Blue 9.

The preferred IUPAC name is disodium;2-[[4-[ethyl-[(3-sulfonatophenyl)methyl]amino]phenyl]-[4-[ethyl-[(3-sulfonatophenyl)methyl]azaniumylidene]cyclohexa-2,5-dien-1-ylidene]methyl]benzenesulfonate

##### Propylparaben

This is a preservative often found in water-based cosmetics and foods. Consequently, it is more relevant to this product’s original application (i.e. coloring food) than to our purposes.

### Rit DyeMore for Synthetics

We reached out to Nakoma Products LLC to ask about the composition of Rit DyeMore, specifically in the Royal Purple colour. Their response (thanks Allie!) encompassed some basic information regarding the dyes used, but for confidentiality reasons, did not disclose the full chemical composition of their products.

Because Rit caters towards casual crafters, their dyes are pre-mixed solutions of various types of dyes in various colours. In this case, the product is a mixture of disperse and direct dyes. While not ideal for this experiment, it is the best we could do given resource constraints.

#### Disperse Dyes

Disperse dyes are water-insoluble and have substantivity for hydrophobic fibres. They get their name from their application – the dye is suspended in fine aqueous dispersion to allow for dye uptake.

CI Disperse Red 17: 3-methyl-4-(4’-nitrophenylazo)-N,N-bis(2-hydroxyethyl)aniline
CI Disperse Violet 1: 1,4-diaminoanthraquinone
CI Disperse Blue 3: 1-(2-hydroxyethylamino)-4-(methylamino)anthracene-9,10-dione

#### Direct Dyes
These are water-soluble dyes that are applied to the fibre from hot aqueous solution. They are therefore most effective on hydrophilic materials. For a time, these were sold as reactive dyes; however, rather than forming covalent bonds with the fibre, they are simply attracted through substantivity (Van der Waals forces and some hydrogen bonding).

CI Direct Red 16
CI Direct Blue 71: Tetrasodium;3-[[4-[[4-[(6-amino-1-hydroxy-3-sulfonatonaphthalen-2-yl)diazenyl]-6-sulfonatonaphthalen-1-yl]diazenyl]naphthalen-1-yl]diazenyl]naphthalene-1,5-disulfonate
CI Direct Black 22: Trisodium;6-[(2,4-diaminophenyl)diazenyl]-3-[[4-[4-[[7-[(2,4-diaminophenyl)diazenyl]-1-hydroxy-3-sulfonatonaphthalen-2-yl]diazenyl]-2-sulfonatoanilino]phenyl]diazenyl]-4-hydroxynaphthalene-2-sulfonate

### Tulip One-Step Tie Dye

No contact was made with Tulip Color, as all relevant information was located on the MSDS for the Tulip One-Step Tie Dye kit.

#### Reactive Dye

These dyes bond covalently with the fabric. They are particularly useful for cellulose fibres such as cotton.

CI Reactive Blue 4: 1-amino-4-[3-[(4,6-dicloro-1,3,5-triazin-2-yl)amino]-4-sulfonanilino]-9,10-diozoanthracene-2-sulfonic acid
CI Reactive Red 2: Disodium;5-[(4,6-dichloro-1,3,5-triazin-2-yl)amino]-4-hydroxy-3-phenyldiazenylnaphthalene-2,7-disulfonate
Sodium Bicarbonate: Sometimes used to increase the pH of a dye solution, when a basic environment is desirable.

## Additives

Some additives were used in the dye baths in order to demonstrate other chemical properties. There is little to analyze on this end, but each product will be listed here.

### Vinegar

The product used in our experiments is white vinegar with 5% acetic acid by volume. According to a pH strip test, it has a pH of approximately 2.

Vinegar is often used in dyeing in order to raise the pH of the dye bath. Acidity has a positive correlation with speed of uptake, percent exhaustion, and dye permanence.

### Salt

We used table salt in our experiments. The ingredients listed are salt, calcium silicate, sugar, and potassium iodide. We were unable to test the pH of salt ourselves, but general conjecture suggests that it is neutral.

Salt is used in some dye baths in order to prevent dye aggregation and drive the dye into the fibres. For example, it can be added to anionic dye baths increase exhaustion on cotton fabrics.

### Detergent

Laundry detergent was used. A pH strip test yielded a value of approximately 8.5, but this is of dubious accuracy since the subject is slightly blue in color. Its MSDS says it has a pH of 9.0-11.0. The listed toxic ingredients are ethoxylated C12-15 alcohols, alkyl benzene sulfonic acid, and sodium carbonate.

Detergent typically serves the purpose of scouring in pretreatment but can also help the dyeing process itself by reducing the surface tension of the liquor or by promoting level dyeing. In some cases, its alkaline nature may help to balance pH.

### Fabrics

It should be noted that none of the following contains specific information. The nature of fabric acquisition tends to be that information is lost to the void, and the reality of my access to tools means that there are limits to the knowledge I can glean myself.

I will make note of the type, opacity (see-through-ness), weight (light-, medium, or heavy-weight), hand (flowy or stiff drape), color, and other.
