In this post, I am going to summarize the content of the paper and link to the relevant posts. Please note that while the paper is somewhat formal, it does not follow all the conventions; there are no in-text citations, and as a result, I made some modifications/educated guesses for formatting the references list.

Find the full paper in PDF form [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1tYAPzp1hPfmQdrlGhUmOogJdozfMfP4c/view?usp=sharing). (It should be version 1.5 -- email me at 655986@pdsb.net if an earlier version is linked anywhere.)

## Abstract

Four types of dyes (ink, acid, disperse/direct, and reactive) were used to colour eleven types of fibre (wool, silk, jute, cotton, paper towel, bamboo, nylon, acrylic, polyester, polyurethane, and polyethylene). Further variations were experimented with by using two different heat settings (room temperature and at boil), and 3 different additives (vinegar, salt, and detergent).

## Introduction

Supplementary secondary research is covered, entailing a brief review of the literature.

## Experimental

The experimental procedure is summarized, and the materials are detailed. Regarding the fabric samples, it should be noted that the characteristic measurements were taken by an individual who nearly failed her eye exam about a week ago and was, just a few hours ago, incapable of reading the number "2" because of a headache. While every effort was made to ensure accurate readings, such as the use of multiple magnifying glasses, the results are still not professional measurements. Use your best judgement when consuming this information.

For more information on the chemical composition of the materials used in the experiment, check the material data sheet, found [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1NWOqqXqVb8PQJOjicIENk1CoqcwrTcM8/view?usp=sharing). Likewise, for a detailed explanation of the step-by-step process, you can read the [updated experimental design PDF](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1oWzcSQVJdO0K7FSIWbDjZ6_O5nxLl9ci/view?usp=sharing), and for an explanation of how we got our initial experimental design, the math can be found in the appendices of our [original experimental design PDF](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1DZGF680ARMBXBzP1tZ__GN-TyKwg9a3m/view?usp=sharing). If you're extremely committed to picking my brain about the modifications to the original experimental design, the blog post can be found [here](https://nathan13888.github.io/GeniusHour/blog/2021-12-06-redux-experimental-design/).

## Results and Discussion

In general, the results are fairly predictable. Adding vinegar to the dyebath tended to bring out red tones; acid dyes tended to strike more red than blue; heat often increased dye uptake; hydrophobic synthetics rarely took any dye, with the notable exception of the heated dyebaths; and likewise, ink was pretty much entirely unable to bind to the fabrics.

For further discussion on this topic, you may wish to watch one of the aforementioned videos, starting at [9:26](https://youtu.be/VKyVxNapFOY?t=566).

## Conclusions

Really, the best conclusion is that there's no real single conclusion. If there was, it'd probably be out there already, not to be discovered by a bunch of high school students who are barely passing chemistry.

As always -- what's best depends on the situation. Heat is good most of the time, but not _all_ of the time. Samples should definitely be dyed before moving into a large-scale project if getting a specific shade is a concern. Predictability exists in bits and pieces, but formulating a reliable way to foresee what the colour will look like would require more research and experimentation.

Preferably, said further research should be done in an environment where actual tools are available, and with materials that have more specification information available for them.

## Acknowledgements

Most of these are summaries of the corresponding section on the paper, and so they are shorter. This one's gonna be a bit longer, though.

I didn’t say it on the paper to maintain the fragile veneer of professionalism, but seriously, I am eternally grateful for everyone who helped out throughout this project. 99.99% of that had nothing to do with chemistry, and certainly had no viable return on investment. I know that I for one can be a moody, temperamental person, and I really don’t say thank you enough to the people who support me.

So thank you. To my family, who have been living in the wake of the mess that has been this project for months. To my dad, who helped me “debug” (because let’s face it, markdown barely constitutes code) in the middle of the night. To my mom, who commiserated with me when I struggled with the tiniest of CS issues. To my younger brother, whose enthusiasm for this project and my endless dyeing puns has been absolutely invaluable.

To my real life friends, who have been so incredibly patient with me while I worked on this, and stuck through way too many hysterical sleep-deprived messages. To the online knitting community, whose generosity in such banal things as heart-eye emojis were sometimes enough to get me through the last few lines I needed to write, and whose passion kept the flame of my curiosity alive. To all of my teachers, because I know I am not always anything even close to the best student, and I know that putting up with me is rarely easy -- so thank you for, well, not completely eviscerating me with your probably well deserved annoyance.

I am so, so incredibly grateful. Thank you.

If you made it to the end -- thank *you* for reading! Hope you learned something, or at least managed to scratch an itch, even if it was one you didn't know you had.
