I am counting weeks based on total Fridays passed. Also, from this point forward, I (Jasmine) will be referring to everyone in the first person plural (we).

This week, we continued with research, experimental design, material acquisition, and website design. Based on the amount of progress made, we would like to be able to finish performing the major experiment (dyeing with various fibres and dyes) by the next conference. This will allow us to do better, more specialized research into the area of focus. Further discussion regarding topics will be included later in this post.

## Research

In order to maintain readability, not all of our research will be included in this post. The following are a couple of important highlights.

### Sources

Not all research information will be included in this update. However, the following comprises (most of) the sources we have consulted thus far:

These are not all scientific sources, nor are they of utmost reliability (e.g. forum posts). This is a consequence of the fact that much of these resources were used to aid in experimental design -- that is, finding a starting point to best understand the materials we will be working with. As the project progresses, we will be consulting more scientific sources, since there will be a greater focus on the theoretical chemistry of it all.

### Dye Composition

We did research into the chemical composition of different dyes that we will be using in the experiment. It is difficult to ascertain exact formulas given the confidential nature of proprietary information. However, we were able to obtain basic information regarding Tulip One-Step Dye as well as ClubHouse Neon Food Colouring. It is unlikely that any more information will be available, as more exact details are expressly withheld as trade secrets. Despite this, more work must be done in the future in order to attempt to obtain information on Rit DyeMore and Diamine Ink. We have reached out to companies to try to garner further information.

#### Tulip One-Step Dye

Tulip One-Step Dye’s MSDS (2018) gives the following information:

Identity/Synonym | CAS Number | Percentage/Range
--------- | ---------- | ----------
C.I. Reactive Blue 4 | 13324-20-4 | 5-30%
C.I. Reactive Red 2 | 17804-49-8 | 5-55%
Sodium Bicarbonate | 144-55-8 | 30-55%

Based on this, we were able to begin reseach into these component chemicals. Little research has been done at the moment.

### Clubhouse Food Colouring

The packaging for ClubHouse Neon Food Colouring lists the ingredients as *water, propylene glycol, colour (contains tartrazine), propylparaben*. This gives us some information but does not specify what colours are used.

On their website, under the questions section, ClubHouse states the following regarding their Neon Food Colouring in separate responses:

- The pink dye contains Allura Red and Erythrosine
- The blue due contains Brilliant Blue FCF
- The dyes contained in the bos are Allura Red (FD & C Red #40), Erythrosine (FD & C Red #3), and Tratrazine (FD & C Yellow #5)

Regarding their standard Food Colouring, the following is stated:

- The red dye contains Allura Red #40 and Erythrosine Red #3
- The blue dye contains Brilliant Blue #1
- The yellow dye contains Tartrazine
- The yellow and green dyes contain Tartrazine #5

Further research and deductive work must be done to expand on the chemical properties of these component ingredients.

#### Rit DyeMore

Basic research was attempted. Not much could be found on the Internet with regards to the component chemicals (this information appears to be protected as a trade secret). We have reached out to inquire about potential information, but there is little else to do there. In future, we will focus simply on the properties of synthetic disperse dyes.

## Experimental Design

Pretty much all of the math pertaining to experimental design has been completed. However, experimental design is currently a live document, and there are still some housekeeping edits that need to be made before hitting publish on that.

### Material Acquisition

Lists of required materials have mostly been finalized. We have begun doing prep work with the materials currently on hand. At the moment, swatch strips have been cut from polyacrylamide, polypropylene, polyurethane, silk, and cotton. This covers the categories of synthetic, protein, and cellulose. Some personal planning must be done before cutting into polyester (another synthetic, but onethat is so prevalent among modern clothing that any "relatable" study would be remiss to exclude it), and paper towel (pulp) is still under consideration for inclusion.

Centralization of remaining materials, including synthetic cellulose fibers and fountain pen ink, is still in progress. However, there are concrete plans in place.

## Website Design

We have begun creating our website, as is evident by the existence of this post. It has been set up using a static site generator called Jekyll. We are using automatic build continuous integration in order to improve information flow and organization.

Discussions regarding formatting and hosting remain in progress. As we continue to roll out content to the site, it is likely tha tmany kinks will resolve themselves.

## Topic Discussion

We are continuing to hone in on specializing our focus. Experimentally, we will be analyzing how different fibres take different dyes, and how permanent these results are. This will provide visual interest to our “show-and-tell” component. As we make progress with the experiment, there is potential for small adjustments that may impact and/or be impacted by continued discussion regarding focus.

Regarding research, we are examining the use of dyes in the textile industry; the everyday application of what dyes are used in the clothes people wear, and the long-term environmental ramifications of water use and waste disposal. These topics were chosen in order to broaden the target audience for our project -- while not everyone is an indie dyer, most people do wear dyed clothes, and everyone lives on this planet. As our research progresses, we will be able to speak to more focused areas of this general idea.

## Future Goals

In the coming week, we would like to finish gathering materials. Ideally, this will mean that we can get started with experiments so that they are not rushed at the end.

There are no Genius Hour work periods this week. Resultantly, it is likely that not much work will be done. We hope to complete any active research regarding the specific dyes we are using this week. However, this is a soft deadline, out of respect for our other courses.
