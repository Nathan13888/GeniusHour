"Cotton fabric was successfully modified by chitosan-poly(propylene imine) dendrimer hybrid (CS-PPI). Cationization of cotton was conformed through zeta potential test. The effects of grafting variables, CS-PPI concentration, pH, time, and temperature on grafting yield were investigated using both salt-free and conventional reactive dyeing processes. Optimal grafting parameters were found to be CS-PPI concentration of 20 % owf, pH 6, grafting reaction temperature of 50 o C, and time of 18 h. Color strength of dyed modified cotton was markedly enhanced in absence of electrolyte or alkali."

Analysis of the possibility of ink creation from dye. " Using a 20cc glass sample bottle mixed 5 drops of photoflow, 5 drops of glycerine, 18cc de-ionized water with 0.5 tsp of Procion Fire Engine Red dye powder. Shook it up and allowed it to stand for about 10 minutes, there was no precipitate and well, it looked like deep red ink. Checked the pH with the pH meter from the reef tank and she registers 5.5, looking good so far."
