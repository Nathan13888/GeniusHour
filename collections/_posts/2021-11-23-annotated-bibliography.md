Overview of reactive dyes, water treatment, and dyeing technology. Explanation of colour range, pigment, and fibers. Outline of the four parts of reactive dyes: The chromogen or the chromophoric part, the reactive system, a bridging unit, and the solubilising group(s) attached to the chromophoric grouping.

**Ritdye. (n.d.).** ***How to dye using the sink or bucket method.*** **Rit Dye.** Retrieved November 23, 2021, from https://www.ritdye.com/instructions/how-to-dye-using-the-sink-or-bucket-method/.

Dyeing a fabric using the "sink of bucket method", a method in which a sink or large container is filled with water, ideally 140 F. Steps are detailed in the article. "To enhance the color: (1) add one cup of salt when dyeing fabrics containing cotton, rayon, ramie or linen; (2) add one cup of vinegar when dyeing fabrics containing nylon, silk or wool."

**Sadeghi-Kiakhani, M., Safapour, S. (2015). Salt-free reactive dyeing of the cotton fabric modified with chitosan-poly(propylene imine) Dendrimer hybrid.** ***Fibers and Polymers***, 16(5), 1075â€“1081. https://doi.org/10.1007/s12221-015-1075-9

"Cotton fabric was successfully modified by chitosan-poly(propylene imine) dendrimer hybrid (CS-PPI). Cationization of cotton was conformed through zeta potential test. The effects of grafting variables, CS-PPI concentration, pH, time, and temperature on grafting yield were investigated using both salt-free and conventional reactive dyeing processes. Optimal grafting parameters were found to be CS-PPI concentration of 20 % owf, pH 6, grafting reaction temperature of 50 o C, and time of 18 h. Color strength of dyed modified cotton was markedly enhanced in absence of electrolyte or alkali."

***Using dye to make ink.*** **The Fountain Pen Network. (2021, August 24).** Retrieved November 23, 2021, from https://www.fountainpennetwork.com/forum/topic/344496-using-dye-to-make-ink/.

Analysis of the possibility of ink creation from dye. " Using a 20cc glass sample bottle mixed 5 drops of photoflow, 5 drops of glycerine, 18cc de-ionized water with 0.5 tsp of Procion Fire Engine Red dye powder. Shook it up and allowed it to stand for about 10 minutes, there was no precipitate and well, it looked like deep red ink. Checked the pH with the pH meter from the reef tank and she registers 5.5, looking good so far."
