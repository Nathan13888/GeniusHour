For a web-based annotated bibliography of scientific sources, nothing has really changed since last time, so you can check out the original post [here](nathan13888.github.io/GeniusHour/blog/2021-12-16-updated-bibliography). The PDF version of that can still be found at the [Google Drive link from before](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1DL1HD_raEAGdlNlpE71cIoOUmD78cFBx/view?usp=sharing), but it has also been uploaded to Dropbox in case you are working from a non-PDSB account (link [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/kds3v7vvnr2crzh/References%20_%20Genius%20Hour%20_%20SCH4UE-A.pdf?dl=0)).

I also updated the PDF including all sources (not annotated because there is no point in annotation for things like images), which can be found on Google Drive [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1qbB-y23kIuizqPThfiRaIyK3W0aR-XlB/view?usp=sharing) or on Dropbox [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/gb6q2qq389l62cr/redux%20Updated%20Bibliography.v.1.1.pdf?dl=0). I skipped some sources in the bibliographies for the write-ups since they're not super necessary (read: *all* the images that are my own anyways), but I've cited that sort of stuff in the aforementioned PDF for posterity.

Not all of the sources are cited "properly" -- namely, the cases where traditionally, APA would not want them in the references section (e.g. personal communications go in-text but are omitted from the references list since they're non-recoverable). All sources that *are* publicly accessible online have been linked, but for any questions, feel free to give us a shout and we will be happy to clarify anything.
