I'm going to keep this short and sweet, since I have a couple of write ups that are going to get posted in the next few hours. Realistically, this post is just going to comprise some links to YouTube videos and some notes on them.

Reports for the process will be posted in a separate blog post, hopefully within the next hour or three.

Also, for all the videos -- there are no subtitles. I really do not have the time or energy to commit to transcribing and timing all of that by hand. (While I'm apologizing for terrible accessibility, I also can't figure out how to properly integrate IDs with this site, so sorry about that, too.)

## Impractical Solutions, Episode II: Fair Isle Contrast

No, there is not a premiere episode -- when I wrote that, I guess I was more or less referring to my physics project last year, but yeah, there's no actual Episode I. It's just a little nod to the continuity of this supposed channel in-universe.

In any case, this is a 20-minute video that covers the whole nine yards for the hat process: 9 minutes of footage for the creation process, a minute of me stumbling around, 9 minutes of chemistry discussion, and then another minute of bumbling bloopers. It covers most (I'm not going to say _all_, because I did have to cut a lot of content!) of the high points that were relevant to the hat portion of the project, including chemical formulas and diagrams. It's not the final video -- that is still a work in progress -- but it'll serve as in-universe teaching content for Max and Alex as they track down the mysterious killer. Since it's getting mutilated for that video, I'm uploading the full cut separately here -- the better to satisfy anyone's intellectual curiosity should anyone be interested!

Find that video [here](https://youtu.be/VKyVxNapFOY).

### Resources

All of the relevant resources are listed in the description box of the aforementioned video. I'm also going to list them here anyways, just in case anyone has trouble with YouTube.

## Knitting and Dyeing the Rekindling Hat

I linked to this in the [last weekly update post](https://nathan13888.github.io/GeniusHour/blog/2021-12-11-week-vii-weekly-update/), but it's relevant here so...

In case anyone is a textile art nerd who wants to see the full process of knitting and dyeing the hat, with properly cinematic cuts and no voice-crack-filled rambling, a 15-minute project film can be found [here](https://youtu.be/7xaW4bBOjN0).
