## Goals and Accomplishments

Our website acted as a **hub** and **progress tracker** for our research project "How they dyed". Our website needed to be **featureful** and performant as it was critical that our website was quick and **easy to navigate**. Through the website, we were able to write **blogs** which provided project updates about the experiences and things we have accomplished during the course of our research project! The website should also provide **shortcuts** of useful links, such as our **Google Drive** and Github links. Lastly, we wanted to showcase as many photos as possible! Hence, we created a **gallery** page (from scratch) of photos we've taken, most of which were photos of all the dyeing samples that were taken. Unfortunately, _videos were too big_ for Github Pages to host. Hence, they are located in our Google Drive folder!

## What did we use?

This website was built from the ground up as we wanted the highest degree customizability; on the other hand, "normal" *drag-and-drop* website builders are clumsy and would restrict our ability to include the information the way we want it. However, it is quite a bit more work to make a website without these website builders. However, we believe our website is more featureful and looks more modern than some *free* themes that are available on these website builders.

Through the course of the past month, we have used various tools to assist our website developer and design! Most notably, we used **Github**, which is a *code-sharing* and *code-versioning* platform, where we collaborated on the website programming and content writing! Our **source code** is publically available on [**Github**](https://github.com/Nathan13888/GeniusHour) too! More information below!

Our website utilized a *framework* called **Jekyll**. This frameowork allowed for creating *modular* templates to design and reuse various components or data on the website. Within Jekyll, we use **Tailwind** as our CSS styling framework and **Next.js/React** as our Frontend design framework. Using Jekyll, we were able to also use a technique called "**static site generation**" (SSG) which compiles the website into a *static distributable* package that could be hosted on **Github Pages**! We also wrote a **CI** script that automatically builds and deploys the website when new changes are made!

## How we worked together

As mentioned before, we used Github as our main way of working together on the website! Building a website from scratch is not an easy undertaking. It requires a deep understanding of Web Development and also a good understanding of our design requirements. Furthermore, in order to provide a good user experience, we regularly make tweaks to iron out any glitches or to make improvements to the website's functionality. The website content also required any blog writer to be familiar with **Markdown** and **Git** as they have to make "commits" to the project to add or edit a blog on the website. When planning out the content we write on our blogs, we also *frequently* communicate with each other to reach conclusions on our objectives when writing each blog and when making changes to the website! As different members of our team work on different aspects of the research project, we constantly have to adapt the website and our work boards to accomodate for these changes. In the end, I believe our team worked in a resiliant and efficient way of completing **all** our design objectives on the website in a timely manner. We also believe that our decision to write a custom designed website to offer benefits in performance, costs, user experience and website functionalities.
