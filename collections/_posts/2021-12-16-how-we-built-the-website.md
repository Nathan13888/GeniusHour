## Goals and Accomplishments

Our website acted as a **hub** and **progress tracker** for our research project "How they dyed". Our website needed to be **featureful** and performant as it was critical that our website was quick and **easy to navigate**. Through the website, we were able to write **blogs** which provided project updates about the experiences and things we have accomplished during the course of our research project! The website should also provide **shortcuts** of useful links, such as our **Google Drive** and Github links. Lastly, we wanted to showcase as many photos as possible! Hence, we created a **gallery** page (from scratch) of photos we've taken, most of which were photos of all the dyeing samples that were taken. Unfortunately, _videos were too big_ for Github Pages to host. Hence, they are located in our Google Drive folder!

## What did we use?

This website was built from the ground up as we wanted the highest degree customizability; on the other hand, "normal" *drag-and-drop* website builders are clumsy and would restrict our ability to include present our website content in the best way we want. However, it required much more work to make the website without these website builders. However, we believe our website is more featureful and looks more modern than some *free* themes that are available on these website builders.

Through the course of the past month, we have used various tools to assist with our website development and design! Most notably, we used **Github**, a *code-sharing* and *code-versioning* platform, where we collaborated on the website programming and content writing! Our **source code** is publically available on [**Github**](https://github.com/Nathan13888/GeniusHour) too! More information below!

Our website used a *framework* called **Jekyll**. This framework allowed us to create *modular* templates to design then reuse components or data on the website. Within Jekyll, we used **Tailwind** as our CSS styling framework and **Next.js/React** as our Frontend design framework. Using Jekyll, we used a technique called "**static site generation**" (SSG) which compiled the website into a *static distributable* package that could be hosted on **Github Pages**! We also wrote a **CI** script that automatically built and deployed the website when new changes were made!

## How we worked together

As mentioned before, we used Github as our main method of working together on the website! Building a website from scratch was not an easy undertaking. It required a deep understanding of Web Development and also our design requirements. Furthermore, in order to provide a good user experience, **we regularly made tweaks** to iron out any glitches or to make improvements to the website's functionality. The website content also required any blog writer to be familiar with **Markdown** and **Git** as they had to make "commits" to the project to add or edit a blog on the website. When planning out the content we write on our blogs, we also *frequently* communicated with each other to determine the requirements of each task and so that we all knew what each other was doing! As different members of our team worked on different aspects of the research project, we constantly had to adapt the website and our work boards to accomodate for these changes. In the end, I believe our team worked in a resiliant and efficient way in completing **all** our design objectives on the website in a timely manner. We also believe that our decision to create a custom designed website to offer benefits in performance, costs, user experience and website functionalities, was well worth the *extra* work.
